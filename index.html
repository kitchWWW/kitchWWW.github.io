Had a long day of meetings this afternoon, talking to people in some capacity or another exercising the "social/emotional" muscle from noon till midnight. Highlights were the recognition that I am emotionally drained and kind of exhausted about many aspects of life at the moment, and trying to figure out a path towards taking a break resolving some of this built up self-care-debt.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Chatted with Ram about some of the work I am doing and we made a plan for how to start executing. (was going to say "a bit faster, better", etc. but in reality we are just trying to move towards executing at all) Also a notable highlight was chatting with Jonathan where we got to review some really awesome proposals and chat about who we want to work with going forwards, as well as calls with Kimberly and Sean as I am just hopping back and forth between my composer and performer hats. Also mom's birthday :) happy birthday!
    </p>
    <p>Nothing like a good end of the evening chat with tears just quietly rolling down the face for no good specific particular reason, but just the reason of <i>*gesticulates resignedly into the air*</i>.</p>

The birds are really loud outside the window this morning here in Baltimore. Still deciding how many names to drop in here and how much tea to expose. Maybe we'll have an answer tomorrow.

    hi - I'm turning this into a journal of sorts. I'll currently be modeling myself off of Brad Garton's diary, but until I have my own style expect things to be a little rocky as I figure myself out.
    </p><p>
Covid-19 started a year ago, and we've just passed the big anniversaries for that mark. Lori announced today in the workplace group that life will be status-quo as far as offices are concerned until at least September 7th. This is giving me a lot of hope and a lot of grounding in trying to figure out some of the medium-sized questions of life that I've been working through (where to live, and if I should jump ship on the job), even as I'm lucky that the big picture ones remain relatively in focus.
