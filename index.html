    brian ellis is an austin based composer and computer guy. he does some pretty cool stuff with music and computers, and ocasionally puts them together. like the time he went to intern with audible. or when he was a researcher at a ut bioinformatics lab. or the time he went to union pacific to work on the railroads and had too much time on his hands to compose. or the time that he went to the mountains of new mexico and pretended to be a cowboy from 1883. that wasn't actually related to computer science, but he did learn a lot of bluegrass music.
