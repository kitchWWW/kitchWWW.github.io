    hi - i'm turning this into a journal of sorts. i'll currently be modeling myself off of brad garton's diary, but until i have my own style expect things to be a little rocky as i figure myself out.

    covid started a year ago and we've just passed the big anniversaries for that mark. lorie announced today in the workplace group that life will be status-quo as far as offices are concerned until at least september 7th. this is giving me a lot of hope and a lot of grounding in trying to figure out some of the medium-sized questions of life that i've been working through (where to live, and if i should jump ship on the job), even as i'm lucky that the big picture ones remain relatively in focus.
